@demisbellot most of the time, whatever I'm serialising shouldn't be mutated after deserialisation. Just used as input to a function.	195600303725363200
@demisbellot not that I don't appreciate the effort put into them, including by you, just wish they'd work w/types with ctors & no setters.	195600066864627712
@demisbellot I know, the bete noir of my life right now. They're all borked from my pov. I want to give a deserialisation fn that uses ctor	195599611631640578
@ashic I think that the day I've mastered Haskell like I have C# I'll have made it as a dev :)	195597524747296768
@ONE75 not disagreeing - more thinking I hope it's that they didn't think than they knew & chose that approach anyway	195597344115392513
@ashic I've been doing a fair bit of scheme & erlang recently & much prefer the simplicity of these langs so far.	195595883440648193
@ashic yeah - I've made a few abortive attempts to get some Haskell on, I always get to a point where I just don't get it anymore.	195595753329135616
@ONE75 I hope that's why, I really do	195595534474543104
@ashic if C# could support/recognise immutable types (& then optimise their usage in compiler) we'd have a massively better language.	195595055929626624
@ashic definitely - the more I try and learn/use functional langs - the more I find cherished ideas on how I code challenged and overthrown.	195594740819963905
@demisbellot I can see that, I've done similar for readability in a kind of builder - I guess these days named ctor arguments could be used.	195594439471800320
@demisbellot If an object is just a typed tuple to be mutated however then fine, but if it's not used like that it should support its usage.	195592418685501441
@demisbellot besides, using object initialiser ends up with more code in every usage than a ctor.	195592228725465088
@demisbellot he should apply that to blog posts :) Balance has to be struck, but in langs like C# terseness is 2nd to understandability IMO	195591876542345216
@demisbellot saving on typing always turns out to be the worst economy I find.	195590739076448256
@demisbellot or that it's state is valid for usage (its preconditions fulfilled)	195590583031574528
@demisbellot surely the ability to look at a type and know that after instantiation it won't be mutated is worth something?	195590472159334401
@demisbellot I find that so hard to understand I can only think we're talking at cross purposes.	195590223609069569
@demisbellot I'm guessing/hoping that's sarcastic, right?	195589628944846848
@nbarnwell glad I'm not alone in hating it though.	195589300631519232
@nbarnwell I can't understand why they would. Client fulfils pre-conditions, client get's post-conditions. Shouldn't care how it happens.	195589228682424320
Write the class with an explicit ctor, readonly backing fields, and expose only necessary getters. == much easier to reason about.	195588597116702721
Point in case: C# class, auto-properties, all set on construction, never after, all set using  an object initializer, no ctor. Why?	195588271793901569
The necessity to ensure that code is easily reasoned about is massively underrated I find. Studying Meyer should be damn near obligatory.	195586497079029760

@abdullin Definitely, re lang. I find it interesting because I wouldn't use the term or lang these days, so I'd like to know their reasons.	187586517777121280
@abdullin @ashic just me being overly sensitive	187586098833260545
@ashic @abdullin sorry if I'm getting a little shirty, just feel a touch patronised (though I don't doubt it wasn't intended that way).	187557467511730176
@abdullin @ashic Frankly though, I didn't come to this view through ignorance of history of patterns, cqrs, etc... Only perhaps of datomic.	187557003122585600
@abdullin @ashic I thought it interesting that, if they know and chose not to use the language of CQRS world, they did so for a reason.	187556664768086017
@abdullin @ashic But, from a cursory initial reading of the whitepaper & their site, it looks very similar, & I don't think its coincidence.	187556315273494529
@abdullin @ashic Maybe I'm wrong and they were oblivious. Maybe they thought it's not really similar, maybe I'm wrong & it is not similar.	187556101393367041
@abdullin @ashic sweet jesus - very aware of all of these things. Looking at their design it seems *a lot* closer than that.	187555815232765952
@ashic really? Wasn't aware.	187552632255168512
@ashic I don't think this is a 'not heard of' thing - I could be wrong, but I don't think so.	187551538384871424
I guess from a marketing point of view it makes perfect sense.	187551105637552130

@kellabyte But every piece of interop comes at a cost. That's why the first law of distributed systems is as it is, right?	184370698381299712
@kellabyte but doesn't that imply distribution & as we know, that comes with many costs, not least latency, but also complexity	184370497012764672
@kellabyte If you want to build something which, for instance, would benefit from a Java lib that's not on CLR only choice is costly interop	184370162571550720
@kellabyte I don't think that argument transfers to the use of libraries. Even if you're using C++ with SQL Server you still use TDS interop	184369927065579520
@kellabyte ... the quality of the libs & newer langs on the JVM give it the edge (a good edge at that) for a lot of things.	184369691689619457
@kellabyte true, & there can be a myriad of non-technical reasons for picking one over other, but technically they're so similar I think...	184369518649425922
@yevhen thanks for the tip, I'll check it out	184369047721349120
@davybrion yeah, I've been enjoying that. It's great to be able to mark things through the day, then read them on the iPad in the evening.	184367134321803264
@kellabyte much as I like the CLR, appreciate C# and increasingly F#, earn a crust with those techs & exist largely within that community	184366946588962816
@kellabyte Can do that of course, but it comes at something of a cost I think relative to just using the JVM, esp. w/langs like scala now.	184366723460366336
@kellabyte mistook the context for this tweet. Thought it was instapaper vs. delicious (hence my prior tweet)	184366365388447747
@fuzzyness haven't looked at Pinboard.in - will take a peek - thanks for the tip	184366061372710912
@al3xandru @kellabyte maybe I'll find a place for both after I've been using Instapaper for longer.	184365903612362752
If you're wondering, right now that comes from looking at Storm & seeing it can leverage's Zookeeper. ++more examples out there though.	184324183176646657
Yet again, because of this, working in the CLR world - whatever the relative technical merits of CLR over JVM - feels like a poor relation.	184323775544819712
Explosion of OSS libs & other progs in the JVM world born out of nosql systems seems to have revitalised JVM OSS beyond crappy enterprise.	184323384652480512
