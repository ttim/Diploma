@ultrasaurus Certainly not equally so.	195348340303609856
Amazing how tight the Rails job market still is. We've been going for almost a decade. You'd think supply would have met demand by now.	195347729822654464
RT @techpeace: Need a job? I humbly suggest learning Rails. #railsconf http://t.co/VdOvVCEg	195347294470672384
@jscheur We find all our people via http://t.co/TyjWl9iY -- good luck!	195338693177901056
@andy_pe_kr Thanks!	195337154090647552
@austinbv What makes the files horrible? I love the routing DSL. Encapsulate and name related declarations is a great thing.	195231583995830272
@richcollins The data should decide? If you consider the URL data, then that's what's happening.	195230221853671425
@its_damo They will when I bake this into Rails shortly.	195228898374590464
@adman65 instance_eval is great for these kind of config files where you don't want wrapper ceremony.	195223714277761026
@TALlama I don't need to simplify them. They all do useful things. But just like you don't put all your models in one file...	195222760061022208

@AstonJ @bwwrd You're allowed more than one.	195194183403831296
@AstonJ @bwwrd Of course it wouldn't, as evidenced by the overwhelming market support for Apple's products. Anyway, plz unsub me from thread	195193876590493696
@AstonJ @bwwrd Most people use their browser on any kind of computing device. The browser is the most important app ever made.	195192655171428353
@robzolkos Yes, it allows me to update people who care about minute-to-minute details on race day and to RT major announcements.	195008772459077632

@AstonJ The "game" being capitalism. Certainly Apple had and has higher aspirations than profits. See anything Job's ever wrote.	194920067408998400
@buddhamagnet Yeah, it's a more sensible explanation that Apple has fooled the entire world than they're simply just better.	194914543451897857
Net profit of $11.6 billion in one fucking quarter. What a triumph of capitalism: Make the best products, earn the most money. <3 <3 <3	194912721551097856
The game is scored in profits: Apple just announced that they doubled Q2 profits y/y. Hard to comprehend a company being so fucking bad ass.	194912031026069504
@jensenracing @BasLeinders I will have to make do :). I'm also the only one of the three without any Le Mans experience, so not all bad.	194877474088304642
@coreybeaman You bet! Driving for OAK Racing in the #35.	194842285496733698
@OfDubiousMeans Really? I thought it was an ode to being young and curious - kids excel at that! Ear muffins are overrated.	194484134477967360
@obie @jameydavis @wycats I keep reading "won't somebody think of the newbies" articles and calls that stuff like coffee confuse them.	194469689982861313
@obie @wycats A general talk like this is like a Rorschach. People take it to mean things they think it means.	194452803966615552

@randylovin It's better to be the bundler than the bundled!	193388781016064000
@tubbo All depends on the company, but for your vanilla startup shop? Probably not.	193388186779656193
@base10 Because then they'd have to use real math. That's not nearly as useful if you're playing the bigger fool game.	193388036933959680
Incubators are creating the CDO startups by luring in developers with teaser gold too (stock options!), sure to appreciate in value, right?	193386777359290368
@dotnetchris CDOs had tangible value too: A claim on an underlaying house. Startups have less claim on their programmers.	193386049265864705
