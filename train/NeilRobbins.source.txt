Really interesting, short, talk about stuxnet http://t.co/TRCSexDY - sounds a really amazing feat of software dev.
@Imaji Happy Birthday John!!! Let's have a beer when I'm in London next week to celebrate?

No matter what I do, the form inexplicably (it gives no reason) fails validation - just asks me 'Please check if all fields are correct'
Is the 'Eurostar Frequent Traveller Application' form the worst web form I've ever encountered? Probably not, but it's got me wondering.
@Squire_Matt not personally. London has a healthy python community IIRC, there used to be regular dojos I think. Would be a gd place to look

@sarkie_dave sounds like you have a winner then
@sarkie_dave that going back some :) Not that I know of, OOTB. Thinking about it, you'd almost want a git like repo with an index over it.
@colin_jack sadly, that's the conclusion I come to too.
@Grumpydev I hadn't tried that - I'll give it a go, thanks for the tip
If #amazon want to make their windows #kindle reader more usable, let me run multiple instances, or at least have n books concurrently open.
So far it's been my background to coding for most of the day, & I'm still only just over half way through Siegfried.
Wagner's Ring Cycle really is awesome - but it seems like the Deutsche Grammophon recoding I have skips - on my iPhone? Hope its the device.
@helephant sorry :)
@helephant we don't have a GUI, just an API, so it's easier. Plain old nunit for us.
& with that test suite all green I'm as certain as I can be, for now, that the bug I've been working on for the last 7 hours is fixed. Phew!
Best decision I made on my project of the last 15 months was to invest in acceptance tests. We have > 1600 now & they are our thin red line.
@tim_g_robinson when in the future I look for a new role, I'll want it to be in an environment where functional langs are typically used.
@tim_g_robinson I wish someone on the C# language team would :)
If #Microsoft had any respect for their developer community & customers they'd admit #tfs is a disaster & advise on & support migration away
@demisbellot most of the time, whatever I'm serialising shouldn't be mutated after deserialisation. Just used as input to a function.
@demisbellot not that I don't appreciate the effort put into them, including by you, just wish they'd work w/types with ctors & no setters.
@demisbellot I know, the bete noir of my life right now. They're all borked from my pov. I want to give a deserialisation fn that uses ctor
@ashic I think that the day I've mastered Haskell like I have C# I'll have made it as a dev :)
@ONE75 not disagreeing - more thinking I hope it's that they didn't think than they knew & chose that approach anyway
@ashic I've been doing a fair bit of scheme & erlang recently & much prefer the simplicity of these langs so far.
@ashic yeah - I've made a few abortive attempts to get some Haskell on, I always get to a point where I just don't get it anymore.
@ONE75 I hope that's why, I really do
@ashic if C# could support/recognise immutable types (& then optimise their usage in compiler) we'd have a massively better language.
@ashic definitely - the more I try and learn/use functional langs - the more I find cherished ideas on how I code challenged and overthrown.
@demisbellot I can see that, I've done similar for readability in a kind of builder - I guess these days named ctor arguments could be used.
@demisbellot If an object is just a typed tuple to be mutated however then fine, but if it's not used like that it should support its usage.
@demisbellot besides, using object initialiser ends up with more code in every usage than a ctor.
@demisbellot he should apply that to blog posts :) Balance has to be struck, but in langs like C# terseness is 2nd to understandability IMO
@demisbellot saving on typing always turns out to be the worst economy I find.
@demisbellot or that it's state is valid for usage (its preconditions fulfilled)
@demisbellot surely the ability to look at a type and know that after instantiation it won't be mutated is worth something?
@demisbellot I find that so hard to understand I can only think we're talking at cross purposes.
@demisbellot I'm guessing/hoping that's sarcastic, right?
@nbarnwell glad I'm not alone in hating it though.
@nbarnwell I can't understand why they would. Client fulfils pre-conditions, client get's post-conditions. Shouldn't care how it happens.
Write the class with an explicit ctor, readonly backing fields, and expose only necessary getters. == much easier to reason about.
Point in case: C# class, auto-properties, all set on construction, never after, all set using  an object initializer, no ctor. Why?
The necessity to ensure that code is easily reasoned about is massively underrated I find. Studying Meyer should be damn near obligatory.
@RorySmithTimes but then who would the next England manager be?
@RobAshton @Cranialstrain @anthonysteele when it locked up my browser for 5 seconds I started to think that it was an ironic site.
@_jimmys @RobAshton @Cranialstrain @AnthonySteele me too - I'm a specialist in stupid :)
@Cranialstrain @robashton @anthonysteele it depends a lot on what you want to learn & why - general programming, or a specific capability.
@_jimmys @RobAshton @Cranialstrain @AnthonySteele to be fair I've never seen a language that a dev couldn't make crap from :) #justsaying
@RobAshton @Cranialstrain @AnthonySteele thanks, but meh - in the context of delivering a project then maybe, but not for learning choices.
@Cranialstrain @RobAshton I didn't understand - what's a bike shed discussion?
@Cranialstrain agree - wasn't a dig at py for websites (more a dig at js for anything else - but that's another story)
@erujolc agreed - pretty sure that's already the case, think he knows some py already anyway
@Squire_Matt yep - bash certainly got mentioned
@shaochenyu yeah - I can relate to that
@shaochenyu the ruby you use when working with Chef (at least so far for me) is so trivial, it doesn't feel like you're working with a lang.
@shaochenyu I'd definitely recommend looking at chef - from my experiments with it, you don't really need to learn ruby to get going.
@xavierdecoster I'll talk to you on twitter when you come back to LLN and work here again :p
@stack72 @Grumpydev I'm so tempted to retweet that with "one out over" inserted at a suitable place :)
I was asked by a sysadmin yesterday whether he should learn python or javascript. I said python unless he wants to make websites. Opinions?
@Grumpydev nice :) You might not be that far off.

RT @richhickey: @NeilRobbins #Datomic was not inspired by CQRS, but shares some principles with it, principles that predate both.
@al3xandru figured you probably had - thanks for the link
@abdullin Definitely, re lang. I find it interesting because I wouldn't use the term or lang these days, so I'd like to know their reasons.
@abdullin @ashic just me being overly sensitive
@ashic @abdullin sorry if I'm getting a little shirty, just feel a touch patronised (though I don't doubt it wasn't intended that way).
@abdullin @ashic Frankly though, I didn't come to this view through ignorance of history of patterns, cqrs, etc... Only perhaps of datomic.
@abdullin @ashic I thought it interesting that, if they know and chose not to use the language of CQRS world, they did so for a reason.
@abdullin @ashic But, from a cursory initial reading of the whitepaper & their site, it looks very similar, & I don't think its coincidence.
@abdullin @ashic Maybe I'm wrong and they were oblivious. Maybe they thought it's not really similar, maybe I'm wrong & it is not similar.
@abdullin @ashic sweet jesus - very aware of all of these things. Looking at their design it seems *a lot* closer than that.
@ashic really? Wasn't aware.
@ashic I don't think this is a 'not heard of' thing - I could be wrong, but I don't think so.
I guess from a marketing point of view it makes perfect sense.
I'm intrigued a little that in their clearly very CQRS inspired database Datomic don't mention that anywhere & recast the language.
@al3xandru seen this? http://t.co/b38zZpcZ

@AnthonySteele absolutely - see my reply to @markrendle just now.
@markrendle that's basically what I meant. I don't think MS are wrong about there being a market. Just scary that anyone would buy/use it.
It's scary to think, that in a world of github (let alone BitBucket & Launchpad), Microsoft think they can make money from hosted TFS.

@kellabyte where my original tweet came from was a view that all the nosql projects being written on JVM have reinvigorated its OSS big time
@kellabyte All these other things are just justifications for a worse technical option. And I get the superiority generally of CLR platform.
@kellabyte Yes there may be existing cultural attachments/skillsets/investments. But from a clean sheet PoV I can't think why not JVM.
@kellabyte I hear you, & accepting lots of what you're saying, still hold that CLR despite tech merits is a poor choice from tech PoV vs JVM
@kellabyte Absolutely, but I'd be interested to know the tech benefits that introducing CLR into a JVM world wins that pay for the costs?
@kellabyte But every piece of interop comes at a cost. That's why the first law of distributed systems is as it is, right?
@kellabyte but doesn't that imply distribution & as we know, that comes with many costs, not least latency, but also complexity
@kellabyte If you want to build something which, for instance, would benefit from a Java lib that's not on CLR only choice is costly interop
@kellabyte I don't think that argument transfers to the use of libraries. Even if you're using C++ with SQL Server you still use TDS interop
@kellabyte ... the quality of the libs & newer langs on the JVM give it the edge (a good edge at that) for a lot of things.
@kellabyte true, & there can be a myriad of non-technical reasons for picking one over other, but technically they're so similar I think...
@yevhen thanks for the tip, I'll check it out
@davybrion yeah, I've been enjoying that. It's great to be able to mark things through the day, then read them on the iPad in the evening.
@kellabyte much as I like the CLR, appreciate C# and increasingly F#, earn a crust with those techs & exist largely within that community
@kellabyte Can do that of course, but it comes at something of a cost I think relative to just using the JVM, esp. w/langs like scala now.
@kellabyte mistook the context for this tweet. Thought it was instapaper vs. delicious (hence my prior tweet)
@fuzzyness haven't looked at Pinboard.in - will take a peek - thanks for the tip
@al3xandru @kellabyte maybe I'll find a place for both after I've been using Instapaper for longer.
If you're wondering, right now that comes from looking at Storm & seeing it can leverage's Zookeeper. ++more examples out there though.
Yet again, because of this, working in the CLR world - whatever the relative technical merits of CLR over JVM - feels like a poor relation.
Explosion of OSS libs & other progs in the JVM world born out of nosql systems seems to have revitalised JVM OSS beyond crappy enterprise.
