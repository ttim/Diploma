"The Monster Pit" is General Admission only, and Little Monsters unlock it when they arrive to the arena or stadium.	166699588185628672

Direct your insults @ladygaga, I can take it. Don't bring in those who are not alive anymore to defend themselves. Be braver than that.	165160745200386048
Tweets about a 14 yr olds suicide in order to take a jab at me? Consider your integrity making fun at a dead child's pain.	165160292525944832
